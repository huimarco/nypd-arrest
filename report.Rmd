### Q1: Has the arrest rate been decreasing from 2018-2022?
Describe the trend and defend any statistical tests used to support this conclusion.

The response looks like this.

### Q2: What are the top 5 most frequent arrests as described in the column 'pd_desc' in 2018-2022?
Compare & describe the overall trends of these arrests across time.
The response looks like this.

### If we think of arrests as a sample of total crime, is there more crime in precinct 19 (Upper East Side) than precinct 73 (Brownsville)? 
Describe the trend, variability and justify any statistical tests used to support this conclusion.
The response looks like this.

### Given the available data, what model would you build to predict crime to better allocate NYPD resources? 
What challenges do you foresee? Describe how you chose your independent and dependent variables. How would you evaluate the model?
The response looks like this.
